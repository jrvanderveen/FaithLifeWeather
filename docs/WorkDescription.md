# Weather Site

CompanyX is exploring ways of boosting its umbrella sales. The most promising
idea is a website that will let people know if they need an umbrella. A
prototype website was started, but is not yet functional.

Complete the prototype website so that it meets the requirements:

1. Takes a city name as input and displays the current temperature and weather
   conditions in that city. The temperature should be displayed in Fahrenheit.
1. If it is raining, or rain is in the forecast for the next twelve hours,
   recommend the user have an umbrella.

Use [OpenWeatherMap](http://openweathermap.org/api), [Weather Underground]
(https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api), or a similar free weather service.

The page should look like this if there is rain:

and like this if there is no rain:

### Bonus

A bonus feature, not part of the requirements, is to detect the user's location
and instead of requiring the user to enter it.
