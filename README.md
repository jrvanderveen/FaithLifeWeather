Developers notes:

I was not sure whether to follow the template for graphical formating or the images in the docs folder.
I have implementations for both but decided to post the one based on the image.

In the email I was asked about how long the assignment took me:

It took about an hour to get set up with dotnet, yarn, Node 7+ and to re-familiarize with ReactJs. I spent around 3 more hours on implementing the assignment and then around another hour to do the bonus.
